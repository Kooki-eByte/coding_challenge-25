## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before.
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## kylsiu#9227 - Web Idle Game
I am a professional video game developer and wanted to figure out a way to incorporate the ZTM work with that. I generally work with Unity3D/C# on mobile platforms so wanted to create a JavaScript game for browsers instead. My idea is to have an idle game with a funny story - mostly because I hate idle games and want to see if I can figure out how to make one people would like and therefore understand the underlying reasons on why people play them.

## kaem#6578 - Five-on-4
5-a-side football match organizer, to make it easier for friends and colleagues to organize and play football matches.

I will also try to implement match reports feature, to get matches and players' profiles with simple statistics such as matches participation and goals. Weather forecast for dates when matches are played would also be nice...

## jaijg#2202 - My Expenses
Simple Expense ***app with MERN stack*** to track our daily expenses. Having got some basic knowledge in ***REACT*** and Wanted to Learn ***NODEJS***, I guess this is a good time to learn and upgrade myself.

## green_arrow#9809 - Github Timeline
API's and graphical representation of information are hallmarks of modern web applications. GitHub Timeline combines the two to create a visual history of a users GitHub activity.

The goal of GitHub Timeline is accept a GitHub user name and produce a timeline containing each repo and annotated with the repo names, the date they were created, and their descriptions. The timeline should be one that could be shared with a prospective employer. It should be easy to read and make effective use of color and typography.

Only public GitHub repos will be displayed.

## Kooki.eByte#3825 - Customizable Clock
I have started learning first in python and now in Web Developement, as the months have been going by learning i have missed playing with python so im challenging myself with a fun project using some libraries in python to make a clock that can be customized by the user with certain things like the color of the clock and perhaps even a design change of the clock. Time will tell but really excited to grow in this process with everyone aboard!

Aiming to learn Docker, a CI/CD tool, Django (DRF), React, and Heroku. And Google Drive and Dropbox APIs, but we'll see how it goes.
